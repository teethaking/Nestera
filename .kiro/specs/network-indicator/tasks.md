# Implementation Plan: Network Indicator for Stellar Networks

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Network Indicator feature into discrete, sequential tasks. The feature adds visual network awareness to the TopNav component, displaying whether users are connected to Mainnet or Testnet with appropriate styling and warnings. The implementation follows a bottom-up approach: creating reusable components first, then integrating them into the existing TopNav, and finally adding network change detection and testing.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional testing tasks and can be skipped for faster MVP delivery
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation and provide opportunities for user feedback
- The implementation follows a bottom-up approach: components first, then integration, then enhancements
- All components use TypeScript with strict typing (no `any` types)
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS consistent with existing codebase
- No new dependencies are required beyond what's already in the project
- The feature is additive and does not modify existing WalletContext API
- Network switching is read-only; actual switching happens through Freighter extension UI
- Testing strategy includes unit tests, integration tests, accessibility tests, and performance tests
- The feature gracefully handles edge cases like missing Freighter extension or unknown network values
